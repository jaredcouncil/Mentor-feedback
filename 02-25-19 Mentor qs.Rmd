```

### CHIS data

```{r adult}
head(adult)
```

## Question 1
What is difference between col and fill in plot code below?

```{r adult}
library(ggplot2)
# Age colored by BMI
ggplot(adult, aes(x = SRAGE_P, col = BMI_P, fill = factor(RBMI))) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

Question 2
Can you explain what the function "x/sum(x)"" is doing? Is it adding up everything in an age group and then giving the proportion for each? 

```{r adult}
# Create DF with table()
DF <- table(adult$RBMI, adult$SRAGE_P)
head(DF)

# Use apply on DF to get frequency of each group
DF_freq <- apply(DF, 2, function(x) x/sum(x))
head(DF_freq)

```
